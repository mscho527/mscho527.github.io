I will give two talks in the upcoming summer, the first in July, about recent developments in quantum computing and bootstrap embedding at the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT). In August, I will discuss my work related to bootstrap embedding at ACS Fall 2024 during the session "Addressing the Complexity of Correlated Quantum Many-body Problems by Embedding and Downfolding." I look forward to sharing my recent works!
