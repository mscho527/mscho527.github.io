This summer, I will give two talks -- the first in May at NTT Basic Research Laboratories and the second in June at the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science. I will also give two poster presentations: Molecular Quantum Mechanics (MQM) Kyoto 2025 meeting (May) and Telluride School on Theoretical Chemistry 2025 (July). I look forward to discussing my recent works with a wider audience!
