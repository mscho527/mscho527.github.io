During my undergraduate years at Brown, I worked as an undergraduate teaching assistant for CHEM330 (Equilibrium, Rate, and Structure) in Fall 2020, Spring 2021, and Fall 2021 semesters. I also worked as a computational lab teaching assistant for CHEM500 (Inorganic Chemistry) in Spring 2021 semester. 
 
I will be working as a graduate teaching assistant at MIT in the upcoming Fall 2022 semester and will be TA-ing 5.601 (Thermodynamics I) and 5.602 (Thermodynamics II & Kinetics). More details will be updated in the coming months.
