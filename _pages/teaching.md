I have worked as a teaching assistant for a few courses, as listed below, during my graduate and undergraduate studies.
- [5.601/5.602](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m5b.html#5.601) (HTA; MIT Fall 2022 / TA; Spring 2023)
- [CHEM330](https://cab.brown.edu/?subj=CHEM&term=999999?kw=CHEM0330) (UTA; Brown Fall 2020, Spring 2021, Fall 2021)
- [CHEM500](https://cab.brown.edu/?subj=CHEM&term=999999?kw=CHEM0500) (Lab UTA; Brown Spring 2021)

### 5.601/5.602

5.601 (Thermodynamics I) and 5.602 (Thermodynamics II and Kinetics) are half-term courses usually taken by sophomores and juniors in Course 5 or 10. As the Head TA for the course in the fall, I have coordinated the course logistics, managed student accommodations, and set up course LMS tools on top of the normal teaching duties. I taught weekly recitation sections, where I tried to review lecture materials and incorporate applications in current research and in industry. I am glad that I could contribute to chemistry education at MIT and have also received positive reviews from the students (6.3, 7.0, 6.3, 7.0 overall ratings out of 7.0 for Fall 5.601/2 and Spring 5.601/2 respectively).


### CHEM330 Group Problem Solving Sessions (GPS)

CHEM330 (Equilibrium, Rate, and Structure) is often the first (or the second) Chemistry course students take at Brown. Group Problem Sessions are weekly tutorials where students collectively solve practice problems with their peers. During COVID-affected semesters, I tried to utilize teaching tools (i.e. writing tablets) to maintain the collaborative atmosphere of the GPS sessions amid the global pandemic.


### CHEM500 Computational Lab

CHEM500 (Inorganic Chemistry) shifted from its normally physical lab experience to a computational alternative during the pandemic. In this course often taken by sophomore, junior, and senior students concentrating in Chemistry, many students had the chance to run quantum chemical calculations on a computing cluster for the first time. With a few other TAs, I assisted the students with troubleshooting issues students face when navigating Linux clusters, running computational chemistry packages, and interpreting the calculated results.
